-- Test cases for incremental error streaming. Each test case consists of two
-- sections.
-- The first section contains [case NAME] followed by the input code, while
-- the second section contains [out] followed by the output from the checker.
-- Each time errors are reported, '==== Errors flushed ====' is printed.
-- The log.log_checking() function will immediately emit a message from
-- a plugin when a call to it is checked, which can be used to verify that
-- error messages are printed before doing later typechecking work.
--
-- The input file name in errors is "file".
--
-- Comments starting with "--" in this file will be ignored, except for lines
-- starting with "----" that are not ignored. The first two dashes of these
-- lines are interpreted as escapes and removed.
