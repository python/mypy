-- Test cases for reporting errors when a test case uses a fixture with
-- missing definitions.  At least in the most common cases this should not
-- result in an uncaught exception.  These tests make sure that this behavior
-- does not regress.
--
-- NOTE: These tests do NOT test behavior of mypy outside tests.
