# Mypy Release Notes

## Next Release

...

## Mypy 1.15

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.15 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)).
Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance
improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### Performance Improvements

Mypy is up to 40% faster in some use cases. This improvement comes largely from tuning the performance
of the garbage collector. Additionally, the release includes several micro-optimizations that may
be impactful for large projects.

### Mypyc Accelerated Mypy Wheels for ARM Linux

For best performance, mypy can be compiled to C extension modules using mypyc. This makes
mypy 3-5x faster than when interpreted with pure Python. We now build and upload mypyc
accelerated mypy wheels for `manylinux_aarch64` to PyPI, making it easy for Linux users on
ARM platforms to realise this speedup -- just `pip install` the latest mypy.

Contributed by Christian Bundy and Marc Mueller
(PR [mypy_mypyc-wheels#76](https://github.com/mypyc/mypy_mypyc-wheels/pull/76),
PR [mypy_mypyc-wheels#89](https://github.com/mypyc/mypy_mypyc-wheels/pull/89)).

### `--strict-bytes`

By default, mypy treats `bytearray` and `memoryview` values as assignable to the `bytes`
type, for historical reasons. Use the `--strict-bytes` flag to disable this
behavior. [PEP 688](https://peps.python.org/pep-0688) specified the removal of this
special case. The flag will be enabled by default in **mypy 2.0**.

Contributed by Ali Hamdan (PR [18263](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18263)) and
Shantanu Jain (PR [13952](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/13952)).

### Improvements to Reachability Analysis and Partial Type Handling in Loops

This change results in mypy better modelling control flow within loops and hence detecting
several previously ignored issues. In some cases, this change may require additional
explicit variable annotations.

Contributed by Christoph Tyralla (PR [18180](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18180),
PR [18433](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18433)).

(Speaking of partial types, remember that we plan to enable `--local-partial-types`
by default in **mypy 2.0**.)

### Better Discovery of Configuration Files

Mypy will now walk up the filesystem (up until a repository or file system root) to discover
configuration files. See the
[mypy configuration file documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html)
for more details.

Contributed by Mikhail Shiryaev and Shantanu Jain
(PR [16965](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16965), PR [18482](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18482))

### Better Line Numbers for Decorators and Slice Expressions

Mypy now uses more correct line numbers for decorators and slice expressions. In some cases,
you may have to change the location of a `# type: ignore` comment.

Contributed by Shantanu Jain (PR [18392](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18392),
PR [18397](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18397)).

### Drop Support for Python 3.8

Mypy no longer supports running with Python 3.8, which has reached end-of-life.
When running mypy with Python 3.9+, it is still possible to type check code
that needs to support Python 3.8 with the `--python-version 3.8` argument.
Support for this will be dropped in the first half of 2025!

## Mypy 1.14

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.14 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)).
Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features and bug fixes.
You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### Change to Enum Membership Semantics

As per the updated [typing specification for enums](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/spec/enums.html#defining-members),
enum members must be left unannotated.

```python
class Pet(Enum):
    CAT = 1  # Member attribute
    DOG = 2  # Member attribute

    # New error: Enum members must be left unannotated
    WOLF: int = 3

    species: str  # Considered a non-member attribute
```

In particular, the specification change can result in issues in type stubs (`.pyi` files), since
historically it was common to leave the value absent:

```python
# In a type stub (.pyi file)

class Pet(Enum):
    # Change in semantics: previously considered members,
    # now non-member attributes
    CAT: int
    DOG: int

    # Mypy will now issue a warning if it detects this
    # situation in type stubs:
    # > Detected enum "Pet" in a type stub with zero
    # > members. There is a chance this is due to a recent
    # > change in the semantics of enum membership. If so,
    # > use `member = value` to mark an enum member,
    # > instead of `member: type`

class Pet(Enum):
    # As per the specification, you should now do one of
    # the following:
    DOG = 1  # Member attribute with value 1 and known type
    WOLF = cast(int, ...)  # Member attribute with unknown
                           # value but known type
    LION = ...  # Member attribute with unknown value and
                # # unknown type
```

Shantanu Jain (PR [18068](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18068)).

### Support for @deprecated Decorator (PEP 702)

Mypy can now issue errors or notes when code imports a deprecated feature
explicitly with a `from mod import depr` statement, or uses a deprecated feature
imported otherwise or defined locally. Features are considered deprecated when
decorated with `warnings.deprecated`, as specified in [PEP 702](https://peps.python.org/pep-0702).

You can enable the error code via `--enable-error-code=deprecated` on the mypy
command line or `enable_error_code = deprecated` in the mypy config file.
Use the command line flag `--report-deprecated-as-note` or config file option
`report_deprecated_as_note=True` to turn all such errors into notes.

Deprecation errors will be enabled by default in a future mypy version.

This feature was contributed by Christoph Tyralla.

List of changes:

 * Add basic support for PEP 702 (`@deprecated`) (Christoph Tyralla, PR [17476](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17476))
 * Support descriptors with `@deprecated` (Christoph Tyralla, PR [18090](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18090))
 * Make "deprecated" note an error, disabled by default (Valentin Stanciu, PR [18192](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18192))
 * Consider all possible type positions with `@deprecated` (Christoph Tyralla, PR [17926](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17926))
 * Improve the handling of explicit type annotations in assignment statements with `@deprecated` (Christoph Tyralla, PR [17899](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17899))

### Optionally Analyzing Untyped Modules

Mypy normally doesn't analyze imports from third-party modules (installed using pip, for example)
if there are no stubs or a py.typed marker file. To force mypy to analyze these imports, you
can now use the `--follow-untyped-imports` flag or set the `follow_untyped_imports`
config file option to True. This can be set either in the global section of your mypy config
file, or individually on a per-module basis.

This feature was contributed by Jannick Kremer.

List of changes:

 * Implement flag to allow type checking of untyped modules (Jannick Kremer, PR [17712](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17712))
 * Warn about `--follow-untyped-imports` (Shantanu, PR [18249](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18249))

### Support New Style Type Variable Defaults (PEP 696)

Mypy now supports type variable defaults using the new syntax described in PEP 696, which
was introduced in Python 3.13. Example:

```python
@dataclass
class Box[T = int]:  # Set default for "T"
    value: T | None = None

reveal_type(Box())                      # type is Box[int], since it's the default
reveal_type(Box(value="Hello World!"))  # type is Box[str]
```

This feature was contributed by Marc Mueller (PR [17985](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17985)).

### Improved For Loop Index Variable Type Narrowing

Mypy now preserves the literal type of for loop index variables, to support `TypedDict`
lookups. Example:

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class X(TypedDict):
    hourly: int
    daily: int

def func(x: X) -> int:
    s = 0
    for var in ("hourly", "daily"):
        # "Union[Literal['hourly']?, Literal['daily']?]"
        reveal_type(var)

        # x[var] no longer triggers a literal-required error
        s += x[var]
    return s
```

This was contributed by Marc Mueller (PR [18014](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/18014)).

## Mypy 1.13

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.13 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)).
Mypy is a static type checker for Python. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

Note that unlike typical releases, Mypy 1.13 does not have any changes to type checking semantics
from 1.12.1.

### Improved Performance

Mypy 1.13 contains several performance improvements. Users can expect mypy to be 5-20% faster.
In environments with long search paths (such as environments using many editable installs), mypy
can be significantly faster, e.g. 2.2x faster in the use case targeted by these improvements.

Mypy 1.13 allows use of the `orjson` library for handling the cache instead of the stdlib `json`,
for improved performance. You can ensure the presence of `orjson` using the `faster-cache` extra:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy[faster-cache]

Mypy may depend on `orjson` by default in the future.

These improvements were contributed by Shantanu.

List of changes:
* Significantly speed up file handling error paths (Shantanu, PR [17920](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17920))
* Use fast path in modulefinder more often (Shantanu, PR [17950](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17950))
* Let mypyc optimise os.path.join (Shantanu, PR [17949](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17949))
* Make is_sub_path faster (Shantanu, PR [17962](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17962))
* Speed up stubs suggestions (Shantanu, PR [17965](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17965))
* Use sha1 for hashing (Shantanu, PR [17953](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17953))
* Use orjson instead of json, when available (Shantanu, PR [17955](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17955))
* Add faster-cache extra, test in CI (Shantanu, PR [17978](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17978))

## Mypy 1.12

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.12 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type
checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.
You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### Support Python 3.12 Syntax for Generics (PEP 695)

Support for the new type parameter syntax introduced in Python 3.12 is now enabled by default,
documented, and no longer experimental. It was available through a feature flag in
mypy 1.11 as an experimental feature.

This example demonstrates the new syntax:

```python
# Generic function
def f[T](x: T) -> T: ...

reveal_type(f(1))  # Revealed type is 'int'

# Generic class
class C[T]:
    def __init__(self, x: T) -> None:
       self.x = x

c = C('a')
reveal_type(c.x)  # Revealed type is 'str'

# Type alias
type A[T] = C[list[T]]
```

For more information, refer to the [documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generics.html).

These improvements are included:

 * Document Python 3.12 type parameter syntax (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17816](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17816))
 * Further documentation updates (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17826](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17826))
 * Allow Self return types with contravariance (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17786](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17786))
 * Enable new type parameter syntax by default (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17798](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17798))
 * Generate error if new-style type alias used as base class (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17789](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17789))
 * Inherit variance if base class has explicit variance (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17787](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17787))
 * Fix crash on invalid type var reference (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17788](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17788))
 * Fix covariance of frozen dataclasses (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17783](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17783))
 * Allow covariance with attribute that has "`_`" name prefix (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17782](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17782))
 * Support `Annotated[...]` in new-style type aliases (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17777](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17777))
 * Fix nested generic classes (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17776](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17776))
 * Add detection and error reporting for the use of incorrect expressions within the scope of a type parameter and a type alias (Kirill Podoprigora, PR [17560](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17560))

### Basic Support for Python 3.13

This release adds partial support for Python 3.13 features and compiled binaries for
Python 3.13. Mypyc now also supports Python 3.13.

In particular, these features are supported:
 * Various new stdlib features and changes (through typeshed stub improvements)
 * `typing.ReadOnly` (see below for more)
 * `typing.TypeIs` (added in mypy 1.10, [PEP 742](https://peps.python.org/pep-0742/))
 * Type parameter defaults when using the legacy syntax ([PEP 696](https://peps.python.org/pep-0696/))

These features are not supported yet:
 * `warnings.deprecated` ([PEP 702](https://peps.python.org/pep-0702/))
 * Type parameter defaults when using Python 3.12 type parameter syntax

### Mypyc Support for Python 3.13

Mypyc now supports Python 3.13. This was contributed by Marc Mueller, with additional
fixes by Jukka Lehtosalo. Free threaded Python 3.13 builds are not supported yet.

List of changes:

 * Add additional includes for Python 3.13 (Marc Mueller, PR [17506](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17506))
 * Add another include for Python 3.13 (Marc Mueller, PR [17509](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17509))
 * Fix ManagedDict functions for Python 3.13 (Marc Mueller, PR [17507](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17507))
 * Update mypyc test output for Python 3.13 (Marc Mueller, PR [17508](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17508))
 * Fix `PyUnicode` functions for Python 3.13 (Marc Mueller, PR [17504](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17504))
 * Fix `_PyObject_LookupAttrId` for Python 3.13 (Marc Mueller, PR [17505](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17505))
 * Fix `_PyList_Extend` for Python 3.13 (Marc Mueller, PR [17503](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17503))
 * Fix `gen_is_coroutine` for Python 3.13 (Marc Mueller, PR [17501](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17501))
 * Fix `_PyObject_FastCall` for Python 3.13 (Marc Mueller, PR [17502](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17502))
 * Avoid uses of `_PyObject_CallMethodOneArg` on 3.13 (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17526](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17526))
 * Don't rely on `_PyType_CalculateMetaclass` on 3.13 (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17525](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17525))
 * Don't use `_PyUnicode_FastCopyCharacters` on 3.13 (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17524](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17524))
 * Don't use `_PyUnicode_EQ` on 3.13, as it's no longer exported (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17523](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17523))

### Inferring Unions for Conditional Expressions

Mypy now always tries to infer a union type for a conditional expression if left and right
operand types are different. This results in more precise inferred types and lets mypy detect
more issues. Example:

```python
s = "foo" if cond() else 1
# Type of "s" is now "str | int" (it used to be "object")
```

Notably, if one of the operands has type `Any`, the type of a conditional expression is
now `<type> | Any`. Previously the inferred type was just `Any`. The new type essentially
indicates that the value can be of type `<type>`, and potentially of some (unknown) type.
Most operations performed on the result must also be valid for `<type>`.
Example where this is relevant:

```python
from typing import Any

def func(a: Any, b: bool) -> None:
    x = a if b else None
    # Type of x is "Any | None"
    print(x.y)  # Error: None has no attribute "y"
```

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [17427](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17427)).

### ReadOnly Support for TypedDict (PEP 705)

You can now use `typing.ReadOnly` to specity TypedDict items as
read-only ([PEP 705](https://peps.python.org/pep-0705/)):

```python
from typing import TypedDict

# Or "from typing ..." on Python 3.13
from typing_extensions import ReadOnly

class TD(TypedDict):
    a: int
    b: ReadOnly[int]

d: TD = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
d["a"] = 3  # OK
d["b"] = 5  # Error: "b" is ReadOnly
```

This feature was contributed by Nikita Sobolev (PR [17644](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17644)).

### Python 3.8 End of Life Approaching

We are planning to drop support for Python 3.8 in the next mypy feature release or the
one after that. Python 3.8 reaches end of life in October 2024.

### Planned Changes to Defaults

We are planning to enable `--local-partial-types` by default in mypy 2.0. This will
often require at least minor code changes. This option is implicitly enabled by mypy
daemon, so this makes the behavior of daemon and non-daemon modes consistent.

We recommend that mypy users start using local partial types soon (or to explicitly disable
them) to prepare for the change.

This can also be configured in a mypy configuration file:

```
local_partial_types = True
```

For more information, refer to the
[documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-local-partial-types).

### Documentation Updates

Mypy documentation now uses modern syntax variants and imports in many examples. Some
examples no longer work on Python 3.8, which is the earliest Python version that mypy supports.

Notably, `Iterable` and other protocols/ABCs are imported from `collections.abc` instead of
`typing`:
```python
from collections.abc import Iterable, Callable
```

Examples also avoid the upper-case aliases to built-in types: `list[str]` is used instead
of `List[str]`. The `X | Y` union type syntax introduced in Python 3.10 is also now prevalent.

List of documentation updates:

 * Document `--output=json` CLI option (Edgar Ramírez Mondragón, PR [17611](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17611))
 * Update various references to deprecated type aliases in docs (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17829](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17829))
 * Make "X | Y" union syntax more prominent in documentation (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17835](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17835))
 * Discuss upper bounds before self types in documentation (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17827](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17827))
 * Make changelog visible in mypy documentation (quinn-sasha, PR [17742](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17742))
 * List all incomplete features in `--enable-incomplete-feature` docs (sobolevn, PR [17633](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17633))
 * Remove the explicit setting of a pygments theme (Pradyun Gedam, PR [17571](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17571))
 * Document ReadOnly with TypedDict (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [17905](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17905))
 * Document TypeIs (Chelsea Durazo, PR [17821](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17821))

### Experimental Inline TypedDict Syntax

Mypy now supports a non-standard, experimental syntax for defining anonymous TypedDicts.
Example:

```python
def func(n: str, y: int) -> {"name": str, "year": int}:
    return {"name": n, "year": y}
```

The feature is disabled by default. Use `--enable-incomplete-feature=InlineTypedDict` to
enable it. *We might remove this feature in a future release.*

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [17457](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17457)).

 * Use `Generator` type var defaults (Sebastian Rittau, PR [17670](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17670))

### Stubtest Improvements
 * Add support for `cached_property` (Ali Hamdan, PR [17626](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17626))
 * Add `enable_incomplete_feature` validation to `stubtest` (sobolevn, PR [17635](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17635))

## Mypy 1.11

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.11 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### Support Python 3.12 Syntax for Generics (PEP 695)

Mypy now supports the new type parameter syntax introduced in Python 3.12 ([PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/)).
This feature is still experimental and must be enabled with the `--enable-incomplete-feature=NewGenericSyntax` flag, or with `enable_incomplete_feature = NewGenericSyntax` in the mypy configuration file.
We plan to enable this by default in the next mypy feature release.

This example demonstrates the new syntax:

```python
# Generic function
def f[T](x: T) -> T: ...

reveal_type(f(1))  # Revealed type is 'int'

# Generic class
class C[T]:
    def __init__(self, x: T) -> None:
       self.x = x

c = C('a')
reveal_type(c.x)  # Revealed type is 'str'

# Type alias
type A[T] = C[list[T]]
```

This feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo.


### Support for `functools.partial`

Mypy now type checks uses of `functools.partial`. Previously mypy would accept arbitrary arguments.

This example will now produce an error:

```python
from functools import partial

def f(a: int, b: str) -> None: ...

g = partial(f, 1)

# Argument has incompatible type "int"; expected "str"
g(11)
```

This feature was contributed by Shantanu (PR [16939](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16939)).


### Stricter Checks for Untyped Overrides

Past mypy versions didn't check if untyped methods were compatible with overridden methods. This would result in false negatives. Now mypy performs these checks when using `--check-untyped-defs`.

For example, this now generates an error if using `--check-untyped-defs`:

```python
class Base:
    def f(self, x: int = 0) -> None: ...

class Derived(Base):
    # Signature incompatible with "Base"
    def f(self): ...
```

This feature was contributed by Steven Troxler (PR [17276](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17276)).


### Type Inference Improvements

The new polymorphic inference algorithm introduced in mypy 1.5 is now used in more situations. This improves type inference involving generic higher-order functions, in particular.

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [17348](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17348)).

Mypy now uses unions of tuple item types in certain contexts to enable more precise inferred types. Example:

```python
for x in (1, 'x'):
    # Previously inferred as 'object'
    reveal_type(x)  # Revealed type is 'int | str'
```

This was also contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [17408](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17408)).


### Improvements to Detection of Overlapping Overloads

The details of how mypy checks if two `@overload` signatures are unsafely overlapping were overhauled. This both fixes some false positives, and allows mypy to detect additional unsafe signatures.

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [17392](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17392)).


### Better Support for Type Hints in Expressions

Mypy now allows more expressions that evaluate to valid type annotations in all expression contexts. The inferred types of these expressions are also sometimes more precise. Previously they were often `object`.

This example uses a union type that includes a callable type as an expression, and it no longer generates an error:

```python
from typing import Callable

print(Callable[[], int] | None)  # No error
```

This feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo (PR [17404](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17404)).

## Mypy 1.10

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.10 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### Support TypeIs (PEP 742)

Mypy now supports `TypeIs` ([PEP 742](https://peps.python.org/pep-0742/)), which allows
functions to narrow the type of a value, similar to `isinstance()`. Unlike `TypeGuard`,
`TypeIs` can narrow in both the `if` and `else` branches of an if statement:

```python
from typing_extensions import TypeIs

def is_str(s: object) -> TypeIs[str]:
    return isinstance(s, str)

def f(o: str | int) -> None:
    if is_str(o):
        # Type of o is 'str'
        ...
    else:
        # Type of o is 'int'
        ...
```

`TypeIs` will be added to the `typing` module in Python 3.13, but it
can be used on earlier Python versions by importing it from
`typing_extensions`.

This feature was contributed by Jelle Zijlstra (PR [16898](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16898)).

### Support TypeVar Defaults (PEP 696)

[PEP 696](https://peps.python.org/pep-0696/) adds support for type parameter defaults.
Example:

```python
from typing import Generic
from typing_extensions import TypeVar

T = TypeVar("T", default=int)

class C(Generic[T]):
   ...

x: C = ...
y: C[str] = ...
reveal_type(x)  # C[int], because of the default
reveal_type(y)  # C[str]
```

TypeVar defaults will be added to the `typing` module in Python 3.13, but they
can be used with earlier Python releases by importing `TypeVar` from
`typing_extensions`.

This feature was contributed by Marc Mueller (PR [16878](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16878)
and PR [16925](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16925)).

### Support TypeAliasType (PEP 695)
As part of the initial steps towards implementing [PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/), mypy now supports `TypeAliasType`.
`TypeAliasType` provides a backport of the new `type` statement in Python 3.12.

```python
type ListOrSet[T] = list[T] | set[T]
```

is equivalent to:

```python
T = TypeVar("T")
ListOrSet = TypeAliasType("ListOrSet", list[T] | set[T], type_params=(T,))
```

Example of use in mypy:

```python
from typing_extensions import TypeAliasType, TypeVar

NewUnionType = TypeAliasType("NewUnionType", int | str)
x: NewUnionType = 42
y: NewUnionType = 'a'
z: NewUnionType = object()  # error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "object", variable has type "int | str")  [assignment]

T = TypeVar("T")
ListOrSet = TypeAliasType("ListOrSet", list[T] | set[T], type_params=(T,))
a: ListOrSet[int] = [1, 2]
b: ListOrSet[str] = {'a', 'b'}
c: ListOrSet[str] = 'test'  # error: Incompatible types in assignment (expression has type "str", variable has type "list[str] | set[str]")  [assignment]
```

`TypeAliasType` was added to the `typing` module in Python 3.12, but it can be used with earlier Python releases by importing from `typing_extensions`.

This feature was contributed by Ali Hamdan (PR [16926](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16926), PR [17038](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17038) and PR [17053](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17053))

### Detect Additional Unsafe Uses of super()

Mypy will reject unsafe uses of `super()` more consistently, when the target has a
trivial (empty) body. Example:

```python
class Proto(Protocol):
    def method(self) -> int: ...

class Sub(Proto):
    def method(self) -> int:
        return super().meth()  # Error (unsafe)
```

This feature was contributed by Shantanu (PR [16756](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16756)).

### Stubgen Improvements

Because the version of typeshed we use in mypy 1.9 doesn't support 3.7, neither does mypy 1.9. (Jared Hance, PR [16883](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16883))

We are planning to enable
[local partial types](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-local-partial-types) (enabled via the
`--local-partial-types` flag) later this year by default. This change
was announced years ago, but now it's finally happening. This is a
major backward-incompatible change, so we'll probably include it as
part of the upcoming mypy 2.0 release. This makes daemon and
non-daemon mypy runs have the same behavior by default.

Local partial types can also be enabled in the mypy config file:
```
local_partial_types = True
```

We are looking at providing a tool to make it easier to migrate
projects to use `--local-partial-types`, but it's not yet clear whether
this is practical. The migration usually involves adding some
explicit type annotations to module-level and class-level variables.

### Basic Support for Type Parameter Defaults (PEP 696)

This release contains new experimental support for type parameter
defaults ([PEP 696](https://peps.python.org/pep-0696)). Please try it
out! This feature was contributed by Marc Mueller.

Since this feature will be officially introduced in the next Python
feature release (3.13), you will need to import `TypeVar`, `ParamSpec`
or `TypeVarTuple` from `typing_extensions` to use defaults for now.

This example adapted from the PEP defines a default for `BotT`:
```python
from typing import Generic
from typing_extensions import TypeVar

class Bot: ...

BotT = TypeVar("BotT", bound=Bot, default=Bot)

class Context(Generic[BotT]):
    bot: BotT

class MyBot(Bot): ...

# type is Bot (the default)
reveal_type(Context().bot)
# type is MyBot
reveal_type(Context[MyBot]().bot)
```

## Mypy 1.7

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.7 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### Using TypedDict for `**kwargs` Typing

Mypy now has support for using `Unpack[...]` with a TypedDict type to annotate `**kwargs` arguments enabled by default. Example:

```python
# Or 'from typing_extensions import ...'
from typing import TypedDict, Unpack

class Person(TypedDict):
    name: str
    age: int

def foo(**kwargs: Unpack[Person]) -> None:
    ...

foo(name="x", age=1)  # Ok
foo(name=1)  # Error
```

The definition of `foo` above is equivalent to the one below, with keyword-only arguments `name` and `age`:

```python
def foo(*, name: str, age: int) -> None:
    ...
```

Refer to [PEP 692](https://peps.python.org/pep-0692/) for more information. Note that unlike in the current version of the PEP, mypy always treats signatures with `Unpack[SomeTypedDict]` as equivalent to their expanded forms with explicit keyword arguments, and there aren't special type checking rules for TypedDict arguments.

This was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi back in 2022 (PR [13471](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/13471)).

### TypeVarTuple Support Enabled (Experimental)

Mypy now has support for variadic generics (TypeVarTuple) enabled by default, as an experimental feature. Refer to [PEP 646](https://peps.python.org/pep-0646/) for the details.

TypeVarTuple was implemented by Jared Hance and Ivan Levkivskyi over several mypy releases, with help from Jukka Lehtosalo.

Changes included in this release:

 * Fix handling of tuple type context with unpacks (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16444](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16444))
 * Handle TypeVarTuples when checking overload constraints (robjhornby, PR [16428](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16428))
 * Enable Unpack/TypeVarTuple support (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16354](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16354))
 * Fix crash on unpack call special-casing (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16381](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16381))
 * Some final touches for variadic types support (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16334](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16334))
 * Support PEP-646 and PEP-692 in the same callable (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16294](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16294))
 * Support new `*` syntax for variadic types (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16242](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16242))
 * Correctly handle variadic instances with empty arguments (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16238](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16238))
 * Correctly handle runtime type applications of variadic types (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16240](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16240))
 * Support variadic tuple packing/unpacking (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16205](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16205))
 * Better support for variadic calls and indexing (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16131](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16131))
 * Subtyping and inference of user-defined variadic types (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [16076](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16076))
 * Complete type analysis of variadic types (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15991](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15991))

### New Way of Installing Mypyc Dependencies

If you want to install package dependencies needed by mypyc (not just mypy), you should now install `mypy[mypyc]` instead of just `mypy`:

```
python3 -m pip install -U 'mypy[mypyc]'
```

Mypy has many more users than mypyc, so always installing mypyc dependencies would often bring unnecessary dependencies.

This change was contributed by Shantanu (PR [16229](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16229)).

### New Rules for Re-exports

Mypy no longer considers an import such as `import a.b as b` as an explicit re-export. The old behavior was arguably inconsistent and surprising. This may impact some stub packages, such as older versions of `types-six`. You can change the import to `from a import b as b`, if treating the import as a re-export was intentional.

This change was contributed by Anders Kaseorg (PR [14086](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14086)).

### Improved Type Inference

The new type inference algorithm that was recently introduced to mypy (but was not enabled by default) is now enabled by default. It improves type inference of calls to generic callables where an argument is also a generic callable, in particular. You can use `--old-type-inference` to disable the new behavior.

The new algorithm can (rarely) produce different error messages, different error codes, or errors reported on different lines. This is more likely in cases where generic types were used incorrectly.

The new type inference algorithm was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi. PR [16345](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16345) enabled it by default.

### Narrowing Tuple Types Using len()

Mypy now can narrow tuple types using `len()` checks. Example:

```python
def f(t: tuple[int, int] | tuple[int, int, int]) -> None:
    if len(t) == 2:
        a, b = t   # Ok
    ...
```

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [16237](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16237)).

### More Precise Tuple Lengths (Experimental)

Mypy supports experimental, more precise checking of tuple type lengths through `--enable-incomplete-feature=PreciseTupleTypes`. Refer to the [documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html#enabling-incomplete-experimental-features) for more information.

More generally, we are planning to use `--enable-incomplete-feature` to introduce experimental features that would benefit from community feedback.

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [16237](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16237)).

### Mypy Changelog

We now maintain a [changelog](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) in the mypy Git repository. It mirrors the contents of [mypy release blog posts](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/). We will continue to also publish release blog posts. In the future, release blog posts will be created based on the changelog near a release date.

This was contributed by Shantanu (PR [16280](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16280)).

## Mypy 1.6

[Tuesday, 10 October 2023](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2023/10/mypy-16-released.html)

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.6 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### Introduce Error Subcodes for Import Errors

Mypy now uses the error code import-untyped if an import targets an installed library that doesn’t support static type checking, and no stub files are available. Other invalid imports produce the import-not-found error code. They both are subcodes of the import error code, which was previously used for both kinds of import-related errors.

Use \--disable-error-code=import-untyped to only ignore import errors about installed libraries without stubs. This way mypy will still report errors about typos in import statements, for example.

If you use \--warn-unused-ignore or \--strict, mypy will complain if you use \# type: ignore\[import\] to ignore an import error. You are expected to use one of the more specific error codes instead. Otherwise, ignoring the import error code continues to silence both errors.

This feature was contributed by Shantanu (PR [15840](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15840), PR [14740](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14740)).

### Remove Support for Targeting Python 3.6 and Earlier

Running mypy with \--python-version 3.6, for example, is no longer supported. Python 3.6 hasn’t been properly supported by mypy for some time now, and this makes it explicit. This was contributed by Nikita Sobolev (PR [15668](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15668)).

### Selective Filtering of \--disallow-untyped-calls Targets

Using \--disallow-untyped-calls could be annoying when using libraries with missing type information, as mypy would generate many errors about code that uses the library. Now you can use \--untyped-calls-exclude=acme, for example, to disable these errors about calls targeting functions defined in the acme package. Refer to the [documentation](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_line.html#cmdoption-mypy-untyped-calls-exclude) for more information.

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [15845](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15845)).

### Improved Type Inference between Callable Types

Mypy now does a better job inferring type variables inside arguments of callable types. For example, this code fragment now type checks correctly:

```python
def f(c: Callable[[T, S], None]) -> Callable[[str, T, S], None]: ...
def g(*x: int) -> None: ...

reveal_type(f(g))  # Callable[[str, int, int], None]
```

This was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [15910](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15910)).

### Don’t Consider None and TypeVar to Overlap in Overloads

Mypy now doesn’t consider an overload item with an argument type None to overlap with a type variable:

```python
@overload
def f(x: None) -> None: ..
@overload
def f(x: T) -> Foo[T]: ...
...
```

Previously mypy would generate an error about the definition of f above. This is slightly unsafe if the upper bound of T is object, since the value of the type variable could be None. We relaxed the rules a little, since this solves a common issue.

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [15846](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15846)).

### Improvements to \--new-type-inference

The experimental new type inference algorithm (polymorphic inference) introduced as an opt-in feature in mypy 1.5 has several improvements:

*   Improve transitive closure computation during constraint solving (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15754](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15754))
*   Add support for upper bounds and values with \--new-type-inference (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15813](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15813))
*   Basic support for variadic types with \--new-type-inference (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15879](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15879))
*   Polymorphic inference: support for parameter specifications and lambdas (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15837](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15837))
*   Invalidate cache when adding \--new-type-inference (Marc Mueller, PR [16059](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16059))

**Note:** We are planning to enable \--new-type-inference by default in mypy 1.7. Please try this out and let us know if you encounter any issues.

### ParamSpec Improvements

*   Support self-types containing ParamSpec (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15903](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15903))
*   Allow “…” in Concatenate, and clean up ParamSpec literals (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15905](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15905))
*   Fix ParamSpec inference for callback protocols (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15986](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15986))
*   Infer ParamSpec constraint from arguments (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15896](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15896))
*   Fix crash on invalid type variable with ParamSpec (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15953](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15953))
*   Fix subtyping between ParamSpecs (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [15892](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15892))

### Stubgen Improvements

*   Add option to include docstrings with stubgen (chylek, PR [13284](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/13284))
*   Add required ... initializer to NamedTuple fields with default values (Nikita Sobolev, PR [15680](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15680))

### Stubtest Improvements

*   Fix edge case for bytes enum subclasses (Alex Waygood, PR [15943](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15943))
*   Generate error if typeshed is missing modules from the stdlib (Alex Waygood, PR [15729](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15729))
*   Fixes to new check for missing stdlib modules (Alex Waygood, PR [15960](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15960))

## Mypy 1.5

[Thursday, 10 August 2023](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2023/08/mypy-15-released.html)

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.5 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, deprecations and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### Drop Support for Python 3.7

Mypy no longer supports running with Python 3.7, which has reached end-of-life. This was contributed by Shantanu (PR [15566](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15566)).

### Optional Check to Require Explicit @override

If you enable the explicit-override error code, mypy will generate an error if a method override doesn’t use the @typing.override decorator (as discussed in [PEP 698](https://peps.python.org/pep-0698/#strict-enforcement-per-project)). This way mypy will detect accidentally introduced overrides. Example:

```python
# mypy: enable-error-code="explicit-override"

from typing_extensions import override

class C:
    def foo(self) -> None: pass
    def bar(self) -> None: pass

class D(C):
    # Error: Method "foo" is not using @override but is
    # overriding a method
    def foo(self) -> None:
        ...

    @override
    def bar(self) -> None:  # OK
        ...
```

You can enable the error code via \--enable-error-code=explicit-override on the mypy command line or enable\_error\_code = explicit-override in the mypy config file.

The override decorator will be available in typing in Python 3.12, but you can also use the backport from a recent version of `typing_extensions` on all supported Python versions.

This feature was contributed by Marc Mueller(PR [15512](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15512)).

### More Flexible TypedDict Creation and Update

Mypy was previously overly strict when type checking TypedDict creation and update operations. Though these checks were often technically correct, they sometimes triggered for apparently valid code. These checks have now been relaxed by default. You can enable stricter checking by using the new \--extra-checks flag.

Construction using the `**` syntax is now more flexible:

```python
from typing import TypedDict

class A(TypedDict):
    foo: int
    bar: int

class B(TypedDict):
    foo: int

a: A = {"foo": 1, "bar": 2}
b: B = {"foo": 3}
a2: A = { **a, **b}  # OK (previously an error)
```

You can also call update() with a TypedDict argument that contains a subset of the keys in the updated TypedDict:
```python
a.update(b)  # OK (previously an error)
```

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [15425](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15425)).

### Deprecated Flag: \--strict-concatenate

The behavior of \--strict-concatenate is now included in the new \--extra-checks flag, and the old flag is deprecated.

### Optionally Show Links to Error Code Documentation

If you use \--show-error-code-links, mypy will add documentation links to (many) reported errors. The links are not shown for error messages that are sufficiently obvious, and they are shown once per error code only.

Example output:
```
a.py:1: error: Need type annotation for "foo" (hint: "x: List[<type>] = ...")  [var-annotated]
a.py:1: note: See https://mypy.rtfd.io/en/stable/_refs.html#code-var-annotated for more info
```
This was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [15449](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15449)).

### Consistently Avoid Type Checking Unreachable Code

If a module top level has unreachable code, mypy won’t type check the unreachable statements. This is consistent with how functions behave. The behavior of \--warn-unreachable is also more consistent now.

This was contributed by Ilya Priven (PR [15386](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15386)).

### Experimental Improved Type Inference for Generic Functions

You can use \--new-type-inference to opt into an experimental new type inference algorithm. It fixes issues when calling a generic functions with an argument that is also a generic function, in particular. This current implementation is still incomplete, but we encourage trying it out and reporting bugs if you encounter regressions. We are planning to enable the new algorithm by default in a future mypy release.

This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [15287](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15287)).

### Partial Support for Python 3.12

## Mypy 1.4

[Tuesday, 20 June 2023](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2023/06/mypy-140-released.html)

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.4 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### The Override Decorator

Mypy can now ensure that when renaming a method, overrides are also renamed. You can explicitly mark a method as overriding a base class method by using the @typing.override decorator ([PEP 698](https://peps.python.org/pep-0698/)). If the method is then renamed in the base class while the method override is not, mypy will generate an error. The decorator will be available in typing in Python 3.12, but you can also use the backport from a recent version of `typing_extensions` on all supported Python versions.

This feature was contributed byThomas M Kehrenberg (PR [14609](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14609)).

### Propagating Type Narrowing to Nested Functions

Previously, type narrowing was not propagated to nested functions because it would not be sound if the narrowed variable changed between the definition of the nested function and the call site. Mypy will now propagate the narrowed type if the variable is not assigned to after the definition of the nested function:

```python
def outer(x: str | None = None) -> None:
    if x is None:
        x = calculate_default()
    reveal_type(x)  # "str" (narrowed)

    def nested() -> None:
        reveal_type(x)  # Now "str" (used to be "str | None")

    nested()
```

This may generate some new errors because asserts that were previously necessary may become tautological or no-ops.

This was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo (PR [15133](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15133)).

### Narrowing Enum Values Using “==”

Mypy now allows narrowing enum types using the \== operator. Previously this was only supported when using the is operator. This makes exhaustiveness checking with enum types more usable, as the requirement to use the is operator was not very intuitive. In this example mypy can detect that the developer forgot to handle the value MyEnum.C in example

```python
from enum import Enum

class MyEnum(Enum):
    A = 0
    B = 1
    C = 2

def example(e: MyEnum) -> str:  # Error: Missing return statement
    if e == MyEnum.A:
        return 'x'
    elif e == MyEnum.B:
        return 'y'
```

Adding an extra elif case resolves the error:

```python
...
def example(e: MyEnum) -> str:  # No error -- all values covered
    if e == MyEnum.A:
        return 'x'
    elif e == MyEnum.B:
        return 'y'
    elif e == MyEnum.C:
        return 'z'
```

This change can cause false positives in test cases that have assert statements like assert o.x == SomeEnum.X when using \--strict-equality. Example:

```python
# mypy: strict-equality

from enum import Enum

class MyEnum(Enum):
    A = 0
    B = 1

class C:
    x: MyEnum
    ...

def test_something() -> None:
    c = C(...)
    assert c.x == MyEnum.A
    c.do_something_that_changes_x()
    assert c.x == MyEnum.B  # Error: Non-overlapping equality check
```

These errors can be ignored using \# type: ignore\[comparison-overlap\], or you can perform the assertion using a temporary variable as a workaround:

```python
...
def test_something() -> None:
    ...
    x = c.x
    assert x == MyEnum.A  # Does not narrow c.x
    c.do_something_that_changes_x()
    x = c.x
    assert x == MyEnum.B  # OK
```

This feature was contributed by Shantanu (PR [11521](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/11521)).

*   Don't type check most function bodies when type checking third-party library code, or generally when ignoring errors (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14150](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14150))

## Mypy 1.2

[Thursday, 6 April 2023](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2023/04/mypy-12-released.html)

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.2 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### Improvements to Dataclass Transforms

*   Support implicit default for "init" parameter in field specifiers (Wesley Collin Wright and Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [15010](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15010))
*   Support descriptors in dataclass transform (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [15006](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/15006))
*   Fix frozen\_default in incremental mode (Wesley Collin Wright)
*   Fix frozen behavior for base classes with direct metaclasses (Wesley Collin Wright, PR [14878](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14878))

### Mypyc: Native Floats

Mypyc now uses a native, unboxed representation for values of type float. Previously these were heap-allocated Python objects. Native floats are faster and use less memory. Code that uses floating-point operations heavily can be several times faster when using native floats.

Various float operations and math functions also now have optimized implementations. Refer to the [documentation](https://mypyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/float_operations.html) for a full list.

This can change the behavior of existing code that uses subclasses of float. When assigning an instance of a subclass of float to a variable with the float type, it gets implicitly converted to a float instance when compiled:

```python
from lib import MyFloat  # MyFloat ia a subclass of "float"

def example() -> None:
    x = MyFloat(1.5)
    y: float = x  # Implicit conversion from MyFloat to float
    print(type(y))  # float, not MyFloat
```

Previously, implicit conversions were applied to int subclasses but not float subclasses.

Also, int values can no longer be assigned to a variable with type float in compiled code, since these types now have incompatible representations. An explicit conversion is required:

```python
def example(n: int) -> None:
    a: float = 1  # Error: cannot assign "int" to "float"
    b: float = 1.0  # OK
    c: float = n  # Error
    d: float = float(n)  # OK
```

This restriction only applies to assignments, since they could otherwise narrow down the type of a variable from float to int. int values can still be implicitly converted to float when passed as arguments to functions that expect float values.

Note that mypyc still doesn’t support arrays of unboxed float values. Using list\[float\] involves heap-allocated float objects, since list can only store boxed values. Support for efficient floating point arrays is one of the next major planned mypyc features.

Related changes:

*   Use a native unboxed representation for floats (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14880](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14880))
*   Document native floats and integers (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14927](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14927))
*   Fixes to float to int conversion (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14936](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14936))

### Mypyc: Native Integers

Mypyc now supports signed 32-bit and 64-bit integer types in addition to the arbitrary-precision int type. You can use the types mypy\_extensions.i32 and mypy\_extensions.i64 to speed up code that uses integer operations heavily.

Simple example:
```python
from mypy_extensions import i64

def inc(x: i64) -> i64:
    return x + 1
```

Refer to the [documentation](https://mypyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using_type_annotations.html#native-integer-types) for more information. This feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo.

### Other Mypyc Fixes and Improvements

## Mypy 1.1.1

[Monday, 6 March 2023](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2023/03/mypy-111-released.html)

 We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.1.1 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### Support for `dataclass_transform``

This release adds full support for the dataclass\_transform decorator defined in [PEP 681](https://peps.python.org/pep-0681/#decorator-function-example). This allows decorators, base classes, and metaclasses that generate a \_\_init\_\_ method or other methods based on the properties of that class (similar to dataclasses) to have those methods recognized by mypy.

This was contributed by Wesley Collin Wright.

### Dedicated Error Code for Method Assignments

Mypy can’t safely check all assignments to methods (a form of monkey patching), so mypy generates an error by default. To make it easier to ignore this error, mypy now uses the new error code method-assign for this. By disabling this error code in a file or globally, mypy will no longer complain about assignments to methods if the signatures are compatible.

Mypy also supports the old error code assignment for these assignments to prevent a backward compatibility break. More generally, we can use this mechanism in the future if we wish to split or rename another existing error code without causing backward compatibility issues.

This was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [14570](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14570)).

### Fixes to Crashes

*   Fix a crash on walrus in comprehension at class scope (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [14556](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14556))
*   Fix crash related to value-constrained TypeVar (Shantanu, PR [14642](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14642))

### Fixes to Cache Corruption

*   Fix generic TypedDict/NamedTuple caching (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [14675](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14675))

### Mypyc Fixes and Improvements

*   Generate faster code for bool comparisons and arithmetic (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14489](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14489))
*   Optimize \_\_(a)enter\_\_/\_\_(a)exit\_\_ for native classes (Jared Hance, PR [14530](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14530))
*   Detect if attribute definition conflicts with base class/trait (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14535](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14535))
*   Support \_\_(r)divmod\_\_ dunders (Richard Si, PR [14613](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14613))
*   Support \_\_pow\_\_, \_\_rpow\_\_, and \_\_ipow\_\_ dunders (Richard Si, PR [14616](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14616))
*   Fix crash on star unpacking to underscore (Ivan Levkivskyi, PR [14624](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14624))
*   Fix iterating over a union of dicts (Richard Si, PR [14713](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14713))

### Fixes to Detecting Undefined Names (used-before-def)

*   Correctly handle walrus operator (Stas Ilinskiy, PR [14646](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14646))
*   Handle walrus declaration in match subject correctly (Stas Ilinskiy, PR [14665](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14665))

### Stubgen Improvements

Stubgen is a tool for automatically generating draft stubs for libraries.

*   Allow aliases below the top level (Chad Dombrova, PR [14388](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14388))
*   Fix crash with PEP 604 union in type variable bound (Shantanu, PR [14557](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14557))
*   Preserve PEP 604 unions in generated .pyi files (hamdanal, PR [14601](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14601))

### Stubtest Improvements

Stubtest is a tool for testing that stubs conform to the implementations.

*   Update message format so that it’s easier to go to error location (Avasam, PR [14437](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14437))

## Mypy 1.0

[Monday, 6 February 2023](https://mypy-lang.blogspot.com/2023/02/mypy-10-released.html)

We’ve just uploaded mypy 1.0 to the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/)). Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:

    python3 -m pip install -U mypy

You can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).

### New Release Versioning Scheme

Now that mypy reached 1.0, we’ll switch to a new versioning scheme. Mypy version numbers will be of form x.y.z.

Rules:

*   The major release number (x) is incremented if a feature release includes a significant backward incompatible change that affects a significant fraction of users.
*   The minor release number (y) is incremented on each feature release. Minor releases include updated stdlib stubs from typeshed.
*   The point release number (z) is incremented when there are fixes only.

Mypy doesn't use SemVer, since most minor releases have at least minor backward incompatible changes in typeshed, at the very least. Also, many type checking features find new legitimate issues in code. These are not considered backward incompatible changes, unless the number of new errors is very high.

Any significant backward incompatible change must be announced in the blog post for the previous feature release, before making the change. The previous release must also provide a flag to explicitly enable or disable the new behavior (whenever practical), so that users will be able to prepare for the changes and report issues. We should keep the feature flag for at least a few releases after we've switched the default.

See [”Release Process” in the mypy wiki](https://github.com/python/mypy/wiki/Release-Process) for more details and for the most up-to-date version of the versioning scheme.

### Performance Improvements

Mypy 1.0 is up to 40% faster than mypy 0.991 when type checking the Dropbox internal codebase. We also set up a daily job to measure the performance of the most recent development version of mypy to make it easier to track changes in performance.

Many optimizations contributed to this improvement:

*   Improve performance for errors on class with many attributes (Shantanu, PR [14379](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14379))
*   Speed up make\_simplified\_union (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14370](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14370))
*   Micro-optimize get\_proper\_type(s) (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14369](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14369))
*   Micro-optimize flatten\_nested\_unions (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14368](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14368))
*   Some semantic analyzer micro-optimizations (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14367](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14367))
*   A few miscellaneous micro-optimizations (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14366](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14366))
*   Optimization: Avoid a few uses of contextmanagers in semantic analyzer (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14360](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14360))
*   Optimization: Enable always defined attributes in Type subclasses (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14356](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14356))
*   Optimization: Remove expensive context manager in type analyzer (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14357](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14357))
*   subtypes: fast path for Union/Union subtype check (Hugues, PR [14277](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14277))
*   Micro-optimization: avoid Bogus\[int\] types that cause needless boxing (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14354](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14354))
*   Avoid slow error message logic if errors not shown to user (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14336](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14336))
*   Speed up the implementation of hasattr() checks (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14333](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14333))
*   Avoid the use of a context manager in hot code path (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14331](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14331))
*   Change various type queries into faster bool type queries (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14330](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14330))
*   Speed up recursive type check (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14326](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14326))
*   Optimize subtype checking by avoiding a nested function (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14325](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14325))
*   Optimize type parameter checks in subtype checking (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14324](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14324))
*   Speed up freshening type variables (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14323](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14323))
*   Optimize implementation of TypedDict types for \*\*kwds (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR [14316](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14316))

### Warn About Variables Used Before Definition

Mypy will now generate an error if you use a variable before it’s defined. This feature is enabled by default. By default mypy reports an error when it infers that a variable is always undefined.
```python
y = x  # E: Name "x" is used before definition [used-before-def]
x = 0
```
This feature was contributed by Stas Ilinskiy.

### Detect Possibly Undefined Variables (Experimental)

A new experimental possibly-undefined error code is now available that will detect variables that may be undefined:
```python
    if b:
        x = 0
    print(x)  # Error: Name "x" may be undefined [possibly-undefined]
```
The error code is disabled be default, since it can generate false positives.

This feature was contributed by Stas Ilinskiy.

### Support the “Self” Type

There is now a simpler syntax for declaring [generic self types](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/generics.html#generic-methods-and-generic-self) introduced in [PEP 673](https://peps.python.org/pep-0673/): the Self type. You no longer have to define a type variable to use “self types”, and you can use them with attributes. Example from mypy documentation:
```python
from typing import Self

class Friend:
    other: Self | None = None

    @classmethod
    def make_pair(cls) -> tuple[Self, Self]:
        a, b = cls(), cls()
        a.other = b
        b.other = a
        return a, b

class SuperFriend(Friend):
    pass

# a and b have the inferred type "SuperFriend", not "Friend"
a, b = SuperFriend.make_pair()
```
The feature was introduced in Python 3.11. In earlier Python versions a backport of Self is available in `typing_extensions`.

This was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [14041](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14041)).

### Support ParamSpec in Type Aliases

ParamSpec and Concatenate can now be used in type aliases. Example:
```python
from typing import ParamSpec, Callable

P = ParamSpec("P")
A = Callable[P, None]

def f(c: A[int, str]) -> None:
    c(1, "x")
```
This feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [14159](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14159)).

### ParamSpec and Generic Self Types No Longer Experimental

Support for ParamSpec ([PEP 612](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0612/)) and generic self types are no longer considered experimental.

### Miscellaneous New Features

*   Minimal, partial implementation of dataclass\_transform ([PEP 681](https://peps.python.org/pep-0681/)) (Wesley Collin Wright, PR [14523](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/14523))
