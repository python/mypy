Native frozenset operations
===========================

These ``frozenset`` operations have fast, optimized implementations. Other
frozenset operations use generic implementations that are often slower.

Construction
------------

Construct empty frozenset:

* ``frozenset()``

Construct frozenset from iterable:

* ``frozenset(x: Iterable)``


Operators
---------

* ``item in s``

Functions
---------

* ``len(s: set)``
